\section{Data}
\subsection{Barcodes and Firms}\label{app:data_bars_firms}
We elaborate on the procedure that we use to associate barcodes with firm ids. The starting point is the data obtained from GS1 that matches the GS1 firm ID to each 8-digit or 13-digit barcode. Then, we assume that with a country, there will be only one firm that owns a particular brand, e.g. Coca-Cola European Partners in Belgium. We do allow for brands to be owned by different firms in different countries. For instance, the soda brand Dr. Pepper is owned by PepsiCo, inc. in most countries, but is owned by Coca-Cola European Partners in the Netherlands. By grouping barcodes through brand-country combinations, we can allow for such structures. As firms may own many country-brand combinations under multiple GS1 firm IDs, we obtain links across GS1 firm IDs when they both own a significant share of barcodes within the same country-brand combination. However, there are a couple of issues with this raw dataset that we need to deal with: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Even though each barcode is associated with only one GS1 firm ID, within a country-brand combination it is often the case that more than one GS1 firm ID owns barcodes.
    \item   Often retailers are owners of some barcodes within country-(non-private) brand combination, for instance for repacking purposes, we might be grouping white label products with branded products through this feature of the data. An even bigger problem arises when retailers own barcodes across many countries-brand combinations because then we would counterfactually group barcodes that are owned by different firms. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent To guard against these concerns, we clean the GS1 firm IDs in the following way. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item   We identify all GS1 firm IDs used by retailers for their private labels and remove them from branded barcodes. In this way, we break spurious GS1 firm ID links through IDs associated with retailers. 
    \item   We remove all GS1 firm IDs that have a transaction share below 10\%. The idea behind this step is to limit the potential for spurious linkages across firms through barcodes that have very little sales. Conversely, if it is really true that a firm has significant operations through more than one GS1 firm ID, it must be that these firm IDs account for a significant transaction share. We note that in most cases there is only one GS1 firm ID that passes this cleaning step, but for some multinationals, e.g. Pepisco, Inc., P\&G, it turns out that barcodes in one country are owned by local affiliates of different nationalities of the same multinational. 
    \item   Related to the previous point, in cases where the largest GS1 firm ID has a bigger than 80\% transaction share in a country-brand combination, we identify this as the only firm ID and remove the smaller ones. 
    \item   Finally, we keep only multiple GS1 firm IDs within the same country-brand combination that has a number of transactions that exceeds 200. If the country-brand combination has a transaction count below 200, we only keep the largest GS1 firm ID. In this way, we determine links across GS1 firm IDs using country-brand combinations that are not occasionally offered.

Observations are excluded because they were not present in each country ("not observed"), because the category was observed, but only consumed by less than 5\% of the households in the sample ("too few observations") or because there are concerns about how the product category is represented. Wine is excluded because France collects a separate household panel for this specific category. First aid and medicines are excluded because countries differ in the extent to which households can access them through regular retail stores. The other category is removed as we are uncertain about the exact nature of such product varieties.}
