In this paper, we pro- vide a direct empirical estimate of firms’ price responses to changes in competitor prices. We de- velop a general theoretical framework and an empirical identification strategy, taking advantage of a new micro-level dataset for the Belgian manufacturing sector. We find strong evidence ofstrategic complementarities, with a typical firm adjusting its price with an elasticity of 0.4 in response to its competitors’ price changes and with an elasticity of 0.6 in response to its own cost shocks. Further- more, we find evidence of substantial heterogeneity in these elasticities across firms. Small firms exhibit no strategic complementarities in price setting and complete cost pass-through. In con- trast, large firms exhibit strong strategic complementarities, responding to both competitor price changes and their own cost shocks with roughly equal elasticities of around 0.5. We show that this pattern of heterogeneity in markup variability across firms is important for explaining the aggre- gate markup response to international shocks and the observed low exchange rate pass-through into domestic prices.},

   abstract = {This article analyzes the heterogeneous reaction of exporters to real exchange rate changes using a very rich French firm-level data set with destination-specific export values and volumes on the period 1995-2005. We find that high-performance firms react to a depreciation by increasing significantly more their markup and by increasing less their export volume. This heterogeneity in pricing-to-market is robust to different measures of performance, samples, and econometric specifications. It is consistent with models where the demand elasticity decreases with firm performance. Since aggregate exports are concentrated on high-productivity firms, precisely those that absorb more exchange rate movements in their markups, heterogeneous pricing-to-market may partly explain the weak impact of exchange rate movements on aggregate exports. © The Author(s) 2012.

   abstract = {The real exchange rate (RER) measures relative price levels across countries, capturing deviations from purchasing power parity (PPP). RER is a key variable in international macroeconomic models as it is central to equilibrium conditions in both goods and asset markets. It is also one of the most starkly behaving variables empirically, tightly comoving with the nominal exchange rate and virtually uncorrelated with most other macroeconomic variables, nominal or real. This review lays out an equilibrium framework of RER determination, focusing separately on each building block and discussing corresponding empirical evidence. We emphasize home bias and incomplete pass-through into prices with expenditure switching and goods market clearing, imperfect international risk sharing, country budget constraint, and monetary policy regime. We show that RER is inherently a general equilibrium variable that depends on the full model structure and policy regime, and therefore partial theories like PPP are insufficient to explain it. We also discuss issues of stationarity and predictability of exchange rates.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Economics, Volume 13 is August 2021.

We find that larger, more productive firms sort into catering to the taste of richer households, and that this gives rise to asymmetric effects on household price indices.

We adopt a model of firm heterogeneity and export participation which we estimate to match moments of the French data using the method of simulated moments. The results imply that over half the variation across firms in market entry can be attributed to a single dimension of underlying firm heterogeneity: efficiency. Conditional on entry, underlying efficiency accounts for much less of the variation in sales in any given market. We use our results to simulate the effects of a 10 percent counterfactual decline in bilateral trade barriers on French firms. While total French sales rise by around $16 billion (U.S.), sales by the top decile of firms rise by nearly $23 billion (U.S.).

The model shows how the exposure to tradewill induce only themore productive firms to enter the export market (while some less productive firms continue to produce only for the domesticmarket) and will simul- taneously force the least productive firms to exit. It then shows how further increases in the industry’s exposure to trade lead to additional inter-firm reallocations towards more productive firms. The paper also shows how the aggregate industry productivity growth generated by the reallocations contributes to a welfare gain, thus highlighting a benefit from trade that has not been examined theoretically before. The paper adapts Hopenhayn’s (1992a) dynamic industry model tomonopolistic competition in a general equilibrium setting. In so doing, the paper provides an extension of Krugman’s (1980) trade model that incorporates firm level productivity differences. Firms with different productivity levels coexist in an industry because each firm faces initial uncertainty con- cerning its productivity before making an irreversible investment to enter the industry. Entry into the export market is also costly, but the firm’s decision to export occurs after it gains knowledge of its productivity.},

In spite of the general use of love-of-variety models, there has been no systematic study of how the import of new varieties has contributed to national welfare gains in the United States. In this paper we show that the unmeasured growth in product variety from U. S. imports has been an important source of gains from trade over the last three decades (1972-2001). Using extremely disaggregated data, we show that the number of imported product varieties has increased by a factor of three. We also estimate the elasticities of substitution for each available category at the same level of aggregation, and describe their behavior across time and SITC industries. Using these estimates, we develop an exact aggregate price index and find that the upward bias in the conventional import price index over this time period was 28 percent or 1.2 percentage points per year.

Within monetary unions, these effects are found to be very minor though, at least when online prices are considered. However, analyzing household scanner price data from three euro area member states, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, we document that households face (and pay) significantly different prices for identical goods across these countries in the vast majority (around 75%) of cases considered. For regions within countries, as a counterfactual, however, no evidence for such effects exists. Employing cross-border shopping information, we are able to draw direct conclusions about the question of integration of markets for a substantial number of goods. In addition, we can also derive a measure of border costs for most of them. For goods, for which no cross-border shopping take place, we provide a lower bound for border costs in the majority of cases. In line with existing evidence, our findings suggest considerable heterogeneities in border costs. Median values generally range between 15% and 20% (of the price of a good) for exact border cost estimates and between 18% and 20% for the derived lower bounds. Considering the distribution of values obtained suggests that most values lie in a range of ±40%. Since our data set comprises purchase information from all major retailers present in a given market, we are also able to examine the role of retailer heterogeneity for cross-border price gap estimates. Differences in retailer composition turn out to be fairly small, however. Grouping goods by various characteristics reveals that goods purchased more often tend to exhibit somewhat bigger border estimates. Considering the price or the goods category, however, does not yield any conclusive insights.},

By failing to allow for this association, the Sato-Vartia index underweights drops in taste-adjusted prices and overweights increases in taste-adjusted prices, leading to what we call a “taste- shock bias.”We show that this bias generalizes to other invertible demand systems.},

The data underlying these results are mostly comprised of price indexes and price surveys of goods that may not be identical internationally. In this paper, we revisit these three stylized facts using massive amounts of US and Canadian data that share a common barcode classification. We find that none of these three main stylized facts survive. We use our barcode level data to replicate prior work and explain what assumptions caused researchers to find different results from those we find in this paper. Overall, our work is supportive of simple pricing models where the degree of market segmentation across the border is similar to that within borders.},

As a result, the impact of trade frictions on trade flows can be decomposed into the intensive and extensive margins, where the former refers to the trade volume per exporter and the latter refers to the number of exporters. Thismodel yields a gen- eralized gravity equation that accounts for the self-selection of firms into export markets and their impact on trade volumes.We then develop a two-stage estima- tion procedure that uses an equation for selection into trade partners in the first stage and a trade flow equation in the second.We implement this procedure para- metrically, semiparametrically, and nonparametrically, showing that in all three cases the estimated effects of trade frictions are similar. Importantly, our method provides estimates of the intensive and extensive margins of trade.We show that traditional estimates are biased and that most of the bias is due not to selection but rather due to the omission of the extensive margin.Moreover, the effect of the number of exporting firms varies across country pairs according to their charac- teristics. This variation is large and particularly so for trade between developed and less developed countries and between pairs of less developed countries. I.},

Zeroes in demand are a common problem in differentiated product markets, but fall outside the scope of existing demand estimation techniques. We show that with a lower bound imposed on the expected sales quantities, we can construct upper and lower bounds for the conditional expectation of the inverse demand. These bounds can be translated into moment inequalities that are shown to yield consistent and asymptotically normal point estimators for demand parameters under natural conditions. In Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the new approach works well even when the fraction of zeroes is as high as 95%. We apply our estimator to supermarket scanner data and find that correcting the bias caused by zeroes has important empirical implications, e.g., price elasticities become twice as large when zeroes are properly controlled.},

Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed estimator provides reliable small-sample inference both with and without selection-on-unobservables.

The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: The upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share from low-to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry.

We develop a framework to estimate markups from production data with multi-product firms. This approach does not require assumptions on the market structure or demand curves faced by firms, nor assumptions on how firms allocate their inputs across products. We exploit quantity and price information to disentangle markups from quantity-based productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing observed prices by the estimated markups. We use India's trade liberalization episode to examine how firms adjust these performance measures. Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected pro-competitive effects. However, the price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of the input tariff liberalization. The reason for this incomplete cost pass-through to prices is that firms offset their reductions in marginal costs by raising markups. Our results demonstrate substantial heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time and suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least immediately after the reforms.},

We show that the differential effect of ruggedness is statistically significant and economically meaningful, it is found in Africa only, it cannot be explained by other factors like Africa's unique geographic environment, and it is fully accounted for by the history of the slave trades.},

The second part applies the methodology to the long-run allocation of capital and consumption in a large cross section of countries. We find that countries that grow faster in the long run also tend to save more both domestically and internationally. These facts suggest that either the long-run allocation of resources across countries is inefficient, or that there is a systematic relation between fast growth and preference for delayed consumption. The third part applies the methodology to the allocation of resources across developed countries at the business cycle frequency. Here we discuss how evidence on international quantity comovement, exchange rates, asset prices, and international portfolio holdings can be used to assess efficiency. Overall, quantities and portfolios appear consistent with efficiency, while evidence from prices is difficult to interpret using standard models. The welfare costs associated with an inefficient allocation of resources over the business cycle can be significant if shocks to relative country permanent income are large. In those cases partial financial liberalization can lower welfare. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {We use a novel data set of online prices of identical goods sold by four large global retailers in dozens of countries to study good-level real exchange rates and their aggregated behavior. First, in contrast to the prior literature, we demonstrate that the law of one price holds very well within currency unions for tens of thousands of goods sold by each of the retailers, implying good-level real exchange rates often equal to 1. Prices of these same goods exhibit large deviations from the law of one price outside of currency unions, even when the nominal exchange rate is pegged. This clarifies that the common currency per se, and not simply the lack of nominal volatility, is important in reducing crosscountry price dispersion. Second, we derive a new decomposition that shows that good-level real exchange rates in our data predominantly reflect differences in prices at the time products are first introduced, as opposed to the component emerging from heterogeneous passthrough or from nominal rigidities during the life of the good. Further, these international relative prices measured at the time of introduction move together with the nominal exchange rate. This stands in sharp contrast to pricing behavior in models where all price rigidity for any given good is due simply to costly price adjustment for that good. © The Author(s) 2014.
